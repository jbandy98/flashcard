This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.1.

## Flashcard Trainer UI App

The flashcard trainer app is the frontend for the flashcard web application. This client interfaces with the java backend
to allow users to create and edit flashcards and flashcard sets. Users can then go in and flip through flashcards for
practice and study.

This Angular application will utilize multiple features of Angular such as Angular material, services, directives,
and custom dialogs and modals, to name a few.
